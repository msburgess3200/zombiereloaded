Zombie:Reloaded is a SourceMod plugin that will change the gameplay on a Counter-Strike: Source server into humans vs. zombies.

## Note ##
Zombie:Reloaded is migrating to GitHub. Source code repositories on this site will no longer be updated.

New source code repository: https://github.com/rhelgeby/sm-zombiereloaded-3

## Description ##
One or more humans are randomly picked to be a zombie and has to infect all other humans, while the humans try to survive by hiding, climbing, making barricades and shooting zombies away with a knock back force on their bullets.

This project is an open source remake and alternative to c0ldfyr3's Zombie Mod. In addition there are more features to make it flexible and more fun.
